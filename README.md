# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```bash
yarn
```

### Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are
reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
just build
```

This command pulls all the referenced HackMDs, converts YML source files to Markdown, and builds the
website.

### Deployment

https://docs.jamcha.in is automatically re-deployed on every main branch push.
