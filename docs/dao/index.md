# JAM Implementers DAO 

## Background 

JAM Implementers DAO is a community of [JAM Implementers](https://jamcha.in/clients) dedicated to implementing JAM protocols, envisioned to underpin Polkadot’s technical evolution and the future of trustless supercomputing.  

## Aims of the DAO

By implementing JAM and engaging with the Polkadot broader Web3 + trustless supercomputing communities, we aim to advance the Polkadot/JAM  ecosystem and drive real-world adoption of Polkadot+JAM protocols.
