#  Code of Conduct for JAM Implementers DAO

_Note: This is only be taken as a draft and *NOT* considered final._   

This has been adapted from the [Permanence DAO Code of Conduct](https://docs.permanence.io/code_of_conduct.html_).

## Dos and Don'ts

This section provides a brief overview of the expectation and guidelines for DAO members.  

### Dos:

1. Actively Participate: Members should engage in the Telegram/Discord group to advance objectives of the JAM Implementer DAO.  There are no specific benchmarks or rules for participation.

2. Represent Professionally: Always represent the DAO positively and professionally online, at events, and in all forms of communication.

3. Follow Telegram/Discord Chat Rules: Always follow both the private and public rules of behavior outlined below.

4. Adhere to the Code of Conduct: Follow the Code of Conduct and consistently demonstrate respectful and inclusive behavior. Members are expected to uphold the principles outlined in the [JAM Implementers DAO Constitution](./constitution.md) and the [Polkadot DAO Constitution](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/governance-behavioral-track-suggestion-mechanism/10106/15).

### Don'ts:

1. Do Not Violate the Code of Conduct: Avoid any behavior that goes against the program's Code of Conduct, including disrespectful or discriminatory actions. This includes actions that contradict the principles of the [JAM Implementers DAO Constitution](./constitution.md) and the [Polkadot DAO Constitution](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/governance-behavioral-track-suggestion-mechanism/10106/15).

2. Do Not Spread Misinformation: Ensure all information shared about the DAO is accurate.

3. Do Not Represent Without Authorization: Do not enter into partnerships or commercial arrangements on behalf of the DAO without proper authorization or approval from the DAO.

4. Do Not Engage in Conflicts of Interest: Maintain transparency in all actions and avoid activities that could present a conflict of interest.

## Appropriate Engagement with JAM Implementers DAO Members

### Guidelines for Proposers

When engaging with JAM DAO members regarding your proposals, please observe the following guidelines:

1. **Respect Professional Boundaries**: JAM Implementers DAO members provide general observations about ecosystem norms and governance standards. Please do not request specific proposal text, detailed design advice, or personalized consulting from JAM Implementers DAO members.

2. **Avoid Conflict of Interest Situations**: Requesting JAM Implementers DAO members to help design your proposal creates potential conflicts of interest. If a JAM Implementers DAO member provides detailed consulting on your proposal, both they and potentially the entire JAM Implementers DAO may need to recuse from voting on it, undermining their governance duties.

3. **Respect Contribution Boundaries**: While some JAM Implementers DAO members may receive retroactive compensation through Decentralized Voices (DV) such as [DV Cohort 4](https://medium.com/web3foundation/decentralized-voices-cohort-4-delegates-announced-a5a9c64927fd) that is split amongst all members, a proportion of this funding may need to be reinvested in the JAM Implementers DAO to sustain operations, pay for assistance, community management, and event coordination to allow members electing to vote with delegated voting power to focus on governance. Many members contribute their time and knowledge voluntarily. Members may not have professional liability protection for providing detailed consulting advice. Casual requests for detailed proposal design place members in a difficult position regarding their role boundaries and potential conflicts of interest.

4. **Focus on Factual Questions**: When communicating with JAM Implementers DAO members, focus on factual questions about governance processes rather than requesting specific advice on how to design your proposal.

5. **Seek Appropriate Channels for Detailed Help**: If you need detailed proposal design assistance, consider engaging professional consultants through proper channels with clear terms, rather than making informal requests to voting members.

6. **Consult Governance Resources**: For guidance on governance best practices and accountability standards, refer to resources like the [OpenGov.Watch](https://www.opengov.watch), which provides valuable insights on transparent and effective governance processes.

Following these guidelines ensures transparent governance processes and maintains appropriate professional boundaries between proposers and voting entities.

## Private+Public Telegram/Discord/Matrix Chat Rules

Members have a private Telegram/Discord group for communication.  All members must read and adhere to the following rules to keep the group friendly, welcoming, professional, and on-topic.  The rules are few, simple, and are generally recognizable as common decency:

1. Trolling and personal attacks will not be tolerated. This includes provoking individuals, threats of violence, or vulgar remarks towards individuals. Depending on the nature of the offense, this may result in a warning or ban. A majority (>50%) of core members must vote to ban a member from the chat(s).

2. Remain on-topic; our topics have a specific context and the conversations should remain relevant. Channels should not be used to draw attention to alternative groups.

3. Baseless/fake representations of groups or individuals are not tolerated in any circumstance within the chatroom and, once identified, might result in a ban.

4. This is a place for informal and inclusive conversation. It is not an opportunity to ask a specific individual to answer arbitrary questions. No one is under investigation.

5. No (concern-)trolling or otherwise incendiary and/or negative comments and narratives. Keep it constructive and positive.

6. No market, price, or “investor” talk. Members can discuss ICOs, investors, or related topics, as long as the goal isn’t to sponsor investment schemes.

7. No constant ranting/complaining. Members may express themselves and vent their frustrations about a topic. However, the frequency of ranting/complaining should not annoy members.

8. A private group means that all correspondence remains private. It is NOT allowed to take screenshots and spread information from private groups. Leaking private conversations may result in a warning or a ban, as described in the first rule under this heading.

All participants are expected to uphold the above rules in both public and private channels.  Moderators for public channels will be selected from the DAO membership.   Moderators may ban participants who engage in behavior that violates these rules after sufficient warning is provided.  

At the moderators’ discretion, a lesser action (such as warning the individual in question) may be taken. Participants, however, should not count on the good grace of the moderators. In particular, where moderators deem it likely that a single individual is using multiple chat monikers to break the CoC repeatedly, bans without warning may be given. 

If members believe someone in the channel is breaking these rules, members may propose a vote for their removal with proof of offense.  No member can be removed without members.

## Disclaimer on the Mutability of the Rules
Governance is an emergent and evolving field, and we envision it as a space for experimentation and rapid iteration. As such, the rules outlined above are subject to change without prior notice. The most current version of the rules can always be found in our GitHub repository with next link `https://github.com/JamBrains/jam-docs/blob/main/docs/dao/code_of_conduct.md`.

Any DAO member may propose changes to this Code of Conduct by submitting a proposal for vote in the DAO Discord group. Amendments require majority approval (≥50%) and must meet the quorum set for the Big Spender Track.
