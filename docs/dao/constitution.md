# JAM IMPLEMENTERS DAO CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS

## PREAMBLE

We, the members of the JAM Implementers DAO, in order to uphold the principles of inclusivity, equality, open participation, and decentralization, to secure the resilience of the Polkadot ecosystem through multiple client implementations of the JAM protocol, and to protect the rights and interests of all participants, do establish these Constitutional Safeguards as binding principles for the governance and operation of the JAM Implementers DAO for the Polkadot ecosystem.

These Safeguards shall serve to detect, recognize, and constrain harmful behaviors before they escalate, and shall be implemented through blockchain-native mechanisms to ensure adherence to constitutional values rather than political discretion, ensuring that the JAM Implementers DAO honors its declared service profile regardless of the desires, wealth, or power of any economic actors.

## ARTICLE XI: SUSTAINABLE WORK STANDARDS AND ECOSYSTEM WELLBEING

**Preamble**: The JAM Implementers DAO recognizes that extreme overwork poses documented health risks and can lead to serious consequences including death. Research has shown that working more than 54 hours per week significantly increases health risks, and the World Health Organization has reported that overwork contributes to hundreds of thousands of deaths annually worldwide. These standards are established not merely as aspirational goals but as essential protections against documented harms that have affected workers across multiple industries including technology, finance, and retail.

Compliance with these requirements serves as an essential risk management measure that helps reduce potential liability for the JAM Implementers DAO, its governance participants, and the broader ecosystem in cases where team members might suffer health consequences from overwork. These standards are designed to balance ecosystem protection with individual freedom, recognizing that innovation often stems from passionate individuals working intensely on projects they believe in, while preventing systemic requirements of chronic overwork as a condition for participation in treasury-funded initiatives.

### Section 1: Core Principles

The JAM Implementers DAO recognizes that the health, wellbeing, and sustainability of all ecosystem participants are essential to the long-term success of the ecosystem. Therefore:

1. The health and wellbeing of all participants shall be considered a fundamental constitutional value.
2. Sustainable work practices shall be mandatory for all ecosystem activities, whether treasury-funded, volunteer-based, or otherwise.
3. No economic incentive shall be designed in a way that encourages or requires harmful overwork.
4. The JAM Implementers DAO shall actively prevent conditions that lead to burnout, exhaustion, or health deterioration.
5. These protections shall apply equally to all participants regardless of role, seniority, compensation model, or contribution status.
6. No disclaimer, waiver, terms and conditions, or other legal instrument may be used to circumvent these standards or require participants to surrender these protections.
7. These standards are aligned with Article 24 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which establishes that "Everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay."
8. Participation in multiple roles (such as governance and technical implementation) shall not be used as justification for failing to satisfy critical accountabilities, particularly those essential to network operations or security. When workload across multiple roles threatens to compromise critical responsibilities, participants must prioritize their core accountabilities or delegate appropriately. Participants shall not:
   a. Occupy governance positions without actively fulfilling associated responsibilities.
   b. Claim ignorance of governance matters due to focus on other roles.
   c. Retain decision-making authority in roles they cannot adequately fulfill due to competing commitments.
   d. Use technical or specialized roles as shields against governance accountability.

### Section 1A: Individual Autonomy and Freedom

The JAM Implementers DAO respects the autonomy of individual contributors and recognizes that:

1. **Individual Choice**: Independent contributors retain full freedom to determine their own work schedules and intensity based on personal preferences and circumstances.

2. **Mandatory vs. Recommended**: These standards are:
   a. **Mandatory** for treasury-funded initiatives to prevent systemic overwork requirements
   b. **Recommended best practices** for independent contributors to consider voluntarily

3. **Innovation Protection**: These standards do not restrict voluntary intense work when:
   a. Freely chosen by the individual (not required or expected)
   b. Driven by personal passion, innovation, or deep focus
   c. Ideally limited to short periods with recommended rest periods between intense work sessions (independent contributors are encouraged, but not required, to follow the Wellbeing Time Commitments defined in Section 2)

4. **Risk Management Focus**: These standards primarily exist to:
   a. Protect the ecosystem's reputation
   b. Reduce potential liability for the JAM Implementers DAO and its governance participants
   c. Prevent contradictions with core values of human dignity
   d. Not to control individual work preferences or limit innovation

### Section 2: Humane Work Standards

The following humane work standards apply to all JAM Implementers DAO operations, treasury-funded initiatives, and projects officially endorsed through Web3 Foundation recognition or formal governance votes executed through OpenGov. 

Participants must comply with all applicable local, regional, federal, and international laws and regulations regarding work standards in their respective jurisdictions. The standards outlined below shall apply in cases where such laws and regulations do not exist, are not defined, or where these standards provide greater protections than those required by law. These standards shall apply to all participants regardless of geographic location, recognizing that human wellbeing needs are universal and not limited by jurisdictional boundaries:

1. **Reasonable Work Hours**: Participants should have the freedom to maintain balanced lives with work expectations not exceeding 40 hours per week on average, with a maximum of 48 hours including overtime when averaged over a reference period, aligning with Article 6 of the European Union's Working Time Directive (2003/88/EC).
   a. For night work involving special hazards or heavy physical or mental strain (including event management, coordination, or leadership responsibilities), work shall not exceed 8 hours in any 24-hour period, consistent with research on cognitive performance degradation during extended high-intensity work and ensuring at least 11 hours remain for the required rest period.
   b. Where the working day is longer than 6 hours, every participant is entitled to a rest break, aligning with Article 4 of the European Union's Working Time Directive (2003/88/EC).
2. **Wellbeing Time Commitments**:
   a. Sufficient daily rest of at least 11 consecutive hours in any 24-hour period, aligning with the European Union's Working Time Directive (2003/88/EC).
   b. Additional weekly rest time beyond daily rest periods, equivalent to at least 24 hours per week dedicated to non-work activities, which may be taken as one continuous period or split into multiple periods according to individual preferences, with teams implementing staggered schedules to ensure operational continuity while respecting individual rest requirements. This provision intentionally modifies Article 5 of the European Union's Working Time Directive (2003/88/EC), which requires an uninterrupted 24-hour rest period, to better accommodate the decentralized and global nature of DAO operations while maintaining equivalent total rest time.
   c. At least 20 days of complete disengagement per year for all participants directly engaged with JAM Implementers DAO activities or treasury-funded initiatives, with participants free to distribute these throughout the year based on their wellbeing needs.
   d. For the broader ecosystem, these standards shall serve as recommended best practices that participants can voluntarily adopt.
   e. The JAM Implementers DAO shall share educational resources and guidance on implementing these standards within its financial and operational capacity.
   f. The JAM Implementers DAO shall advocate for these standards to be incorporated into the Polkadot DAO Constitution to ensure broader ecosystem adoption and consistent application across treasury-funded initiatives,and projects officially endorsed through governance vote or by authorized representatives
3. **Economic Necessity Exception**:
   a. The JAM Implementers DAO recognizes that economic necessity may require individuals to work beyond these standards to meet basic needs. In such cases, the focus shall be on addressing the root cause through fair incentives when possible, or through scope reduction, prioritization, and delegation when financial resources are limited. Treasury-funded initiatives shall be structured to provide incentives commensurate with the work required, and within the constraints of available funding. When the JAM Implementers DAO cannot provide adequate incentives for a proposed scope of work, the scope shall be reduced or the initiative may not proceed unless alternative incentive sources are secured, rather than expecting excessive hours without appropriate incentives.
   b. Scope adjustments shall be made based on objective assessment of work requirements and available resources, not based on individual financial circumstances, to maintain fairness and avoid creating perverse incentives that could reward unsustainable practices or disadvantage those who work within established standards.
   c. When economic necessity drives overwork, this shall be documented as a systemic issue requiring governance attention rather than normalized as acceptable practice.
4. **Emergency Work Considerations**:
   a. Emergency work periods shall be categorized based on intensity and strain, aligning with scientific research on cognitive fatigue and safety standards:
      i. High-intensity emergency work (such as urgent bug fixing, critical problem-solving, or high-stress coordination) shall not exceed 11 hours in a 24-hour period, consistent with research on cognitive performance degradation during extended high-intensity work and ensuring at least 11 hours remain for the required rest period.
      ii. Lower-intensity emergency work (such as monitoring dashboards or maintaining standby presence) may extend to 13 hours in a 24-hour period (calculated as 24 hours minus the mandatory 11-hour rest period), with mandatory short breaks of at least 15 minutes every 2 hours. These breaks should involve stepping away from screens, preferably with exposure to natural light when possible, and engaging in physical movement. Alertness-monitoring protocols must be in place, aligning with EU regulations for certain emergency services while ensuring the minimum 11-hour rest period is preserved.
   b. All emergency work shall be followed by an additional Wellbeing Time Commitment (Section 2 Item 2):
      i. For high-intensity emergency work, a minimum rest period of at least 11 hours must follow the work period.
      ii. For lower-intensity emergency work, a minimum rest period equal to the duration of the work performed must follow, with a minimum of 11 hours.
   c. No participant shall be required to participate in more than 3 high-intensity emergency response events per month under normal circumstances.
   d. Safety, health, or wellbeing-critical emergencies shall be exempt from the monthly limit when necessary to prevent harm, provided that:
      i. The emergency is properly documented as critical, including:
         1. The specific nature of the threat to safety, health, or wellbeing
         2. Why immediate action was required
         3. Why the emergency could not be addressed within normal work standards
         4. The expected impact if the emergency had not been addressed
      ii. Enhanced incentives and rest periods are provided afterward.
      iii. A post-incident review identifies staffing adjustments to prevent future overreliance on the same responders.
      iv. A risk assessment is conducted to ensure that the responders' wellbeing is not compromised to a degree that exceeds the potential benefit to those being helped.
      v. When multiple responders would exceed their limits, a collective decision-making process must be used to determine the appropriate response that minimizes overall harm. This process shall:
         1. Include at minimum the technical lead responsible for the affected system, a governance representative, and an uninvolved third party with expertise in wellbeing or ethics
         2. Consider both the technical urgency of the emergency and the wellbeing impact on responders
         3. Document the decision-making process, including dissenting opinions
         4. Be conducted according to procedures defined in the Critical Emergency Response Framework
   e. The JAM Implementers DAO shall maintain a regularly updated Critical Emergency Response Framework that:
      i. Proactively identifies and categorizes potential emergency scenarios
      ii. Establishes clear criteria for what constitutes a "critical emergency" exempt from standard limits
      iii. Defines response protocols and decision trees for rapid assessment during emergencies
      iv. Specifies communication procedures and escalation paths
      v. Is reviewed and updated at least semi-annually based on operational experience
5. **On-call Rotations**:
   a. On-call duties shall be clearly defined in writing, with explicit scope limitations and escalation paths, and distributed equitably among qualified team members.
   b. No participant shall be on-call for more than 1 week at a time or more than 2 weeks per month.
   c. On-call incentives shall be provided regardless of whether emergencies occur, with appropriate recognition for volunteer participants.
   d. On-call duty definitions shall be reviewed and updated at least quarterly to prevent scope creep.

### Section 3: Monitoring and Response

The following monitoring and response mechanisms apply to all JAM Implementers DAO operations, treasury-funded initiatives, and projects officially endorsed through formal governance votes and executed on OpenGov. The JAM Implementers DAO shall, subject to available funding and resources, implement these systems to monitor and protect sustainable work practices across the ecosystem:

1. **Work Standards Assessments**:
   a. Regular participant surveys shall be conducted at least quarterly using selective disclosure mechanisms (such as zero-knowledge proofs) to verify unique on-chain identity and proof of personhood while preserving privacy of individual responses.
   b. The JAM Implementers DAO shall maintain a standardized Humane Work Standards Compliance Checklist that:
      i. Covers all key provisions of this Article, including work hours, wellbeing time commitments, emergency work limits, and on-call rotation requirements
      ii. Is published on-chain for transparency and immutability
      iii. Is used to evaluate all treasury-funded initiatives and officially endorsed projects
      iv. Includes objective, measurable criteria for each standard
      v. Is updated at least annually to reflect evolving best practices and community feedback
   c. All treasury-funded initiatives and officially endorsed projects shall complete a self-assessment using the Compliance Checklist at project initiation and at regular intervals thereafter, with results stored on-chain.
   d. The JAM Implementers DAO shall conduct random compliance audits of at least 20% of active treasury-funded initiatives each quarter, with findings and remediation plans published on-chain.
2. **Wellbeing Metrics**:
   a. Self-reported work pattern data that contributors can voluntarily share through privacy-preserving mechanisms.
   b. Aggregated, anonymous workload indicators derived from on-chain activity with explicit contributor consent.
   c. Team-level wellbeing assessments based on collectively defined indicators rather than individual monitoring.
3. **Support Mechanisms**:
   a. Graduated response mechanisms proportional to the severity of concerns.
   b. A designated Wellbeing Working Group, elected through on-chain governance, shall have authority to recommend pausing non-critical work during periods of unsustainable practices. Such recommendations shall be submitted to JAM Implementers DAO governance for consideration, with a required decision within 72 hours. The specific voting mechanism shall be defined in the operational guidelines, with provisions to prevent governance paralysis if quorum cannot be reached. The JAM Implementers DAO shall seek explicit upfront incentive commitments from external sources such as the Polkadot Agents Program before activating this rapid response capability, ensuring participants are never expected to work without pre-committed incentives, even if external programs typically operate on retroactive incentive models.
4. **Whistleblower Protections**:
   a. Reporting channels for work standards non-compliance that utilize selective disclosure mechanisms (such as zero-knowledge proofs) to verify unique on-chain identity and proof of personhood while preserving privacy of individual reporters.
   b. Protection from retaliation for those reporting concerns, with identity protection guaranteed through cryptographic methods.
   c. Independent review of reported non-compliance with verification of report authenticity through the on-chain identity and proof of personhood system.

### Section 4: Treasury Funding and Endorsement Requirements

All initiatives seeking treasury funding, endorsement, or other support shall comply with the following requirements, regardless of funding amount or mechanism (including but not limited to proposals, bounties, grants, sponsorships, and partnerships). These requirements also extend to initiatives not receiving direct funding but benefiting from official endorsement, promotional support, ecosystem branding (such as "Powered by JAM", "Powered by Polkadot", or similar ecosystem associations), or other non-monetary resources from the JAM Implementers DAO:

1. **Sustainable Work**: Include clear sustainable work provisions in their proposals, bounty descriptions, grants, or other funding or support requests that:
   a. Specify how they will prevent systemic overwork, including realistic timelines that don't require unsustainable hours
   b. Budget for adequate team size to ensure work distribution complies with the Reasonable Work Hours standards in Section 2.1
   c. Include proper contingency staffing to minimize the need to rely on emergency protocols as defined in Section 3

2. **Accountability Mechanisms**: 
   a. Demonstrate understanding of these constitutional requirements
   b. Establish transparent reporting on actual hours worked compared to estimates, activation of emergency protocols, and team wellbeing metrics throughout the project lifecycle
   c. Accept that non-compliance with these standards constitutes grounds for reassessment of future staged milestone incentives that were conditional upon adherence to sustainable work standards, potential withdrawal of endorsement, and potential ineligibility for future treasury support

3. **Risk Management**: Include contingency plans that:
   a. Identify potential high-pressure periods in advance and outline strategies to mitigate workload spikes
   b. Specify how critical functions will be maintained without requiring unsustainable work

The JAM Implementers DAO shall, subject to available funding and resources, maintain templates and examples of sustainable work provisions to assist applicants in meeting these requirements. When such templates are not yet available, applicants remain responsible for including appropriate sustainable work provisions in their requests.

### Section 5: Education and Resources

The JAM Implementers DAO shall, subject to available funding and resources, provide:

1. Educational resources on sustainable work practices and burnout prevention.
2. Training for team leads and independent contributors on maintaining sustainable work environments.
3. Access to mental health resources for all participants.
4. Regular workshops on work-life balance in distributed teams and for solo contributors.
5. Documentation of best practices for sustainable remote work.

When resource constraints limit the provision of these resources, the JAM Implementers DAO shall prioritize those with the greatest impact on participant wellbeing and identify external resources that participants can access independently.

### Section 6: Implementation and Accountability

The JAM Implementers DAO shall, subject to available funding and resources, implement these standards through:

1. Regular audits of work patterns across treasury-funded ecosystem activities.
2. Public reporting on compliance with sustainable work standards for treasury-funded initiatives.
3. Economic incentive adjustments for teams, projects, or initiatives that are found to be non-compliant with these standards.
4. Temporary or permanent ineligibility for treasury funding, endorsement, or other official recognition following repeated non-compliance.
5. Recognition and incentives for teams and initiatives demonstrating exemplary sustainable work practices.
6. Nullification of any terms, conditions, waivers, or disclaimers that attempt to circumvent these standards.
7. Prohibition against requiring participants to "opt out" of these protections as a condition of participation in treasury-funded initiatives.

When resource constraints limit full implementation of these accountability measures, the JAM Implementers DAO shall prioritize transparency, education, and prevention over accountability measures, while maintaining core protections against the most severe non-compliance.
