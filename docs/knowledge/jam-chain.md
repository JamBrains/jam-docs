# JAM Chain

The **J**oin **A**ccumulate **M**achine (JAM) is an invention by Dr Gavin Wood formally specified in the [Gray Paper](https://graypaper.com). It is a blockchain network that will provide permissionless and scalable compute to anyone who pays for it.

Yes is is not just the name. The original color schema is inspired by the 2000's electronics music album [Lemonjelly.ky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonjelly.ky). Other color schemas available on [jamcha.in](https://jamcha.in/spec) for your eye's convenience.
