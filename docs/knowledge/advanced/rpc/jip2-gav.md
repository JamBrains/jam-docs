# JIP-2: Node RPC

RPC specification for JAM nodes to ensure JAM tooling which relies on being an RPC client is implementation-agnostic.

## Notes

RPCs are evil and should generally not be used: they lead to chronic centralisation and trust-maximisation (just see Ethereum for a great example of this trap).

However, there are not at present any light clients for JAM and the resources needed to run a regular client make the inclusion of a full-client inside of tooling to be unrealistic. We must therefore reluctantly presume that the tool-user has access to a trustworthy full node and can use its RPCs.

As soon as a light-client implementation is viable, the use of RPCs should be phased out immediately in favour of embedded light-clients in the tooling.

## RPC specification

Both arguments, results and notification types are passed as an array, which may be `null` for certain results (marked as such).

Types:
- `Hash`: a 32 item array with each item numeric between 0 and 255 inclusive.
- `Slot`: a single numeric item between 0 and $2^{32}-1$ inclusive.
- `Blob`: an arbitrary length array each item numeric between 0 and 255 inclusive.
- `ServiceId`: a single numeric item between 0 and $2^{32}-1$ inclusive.
- `Parameters`: an object describing the parameters of the JAM chain. See below for more information.

Generally JSON RPC can be used over a variety of media and we don't make any assumptions of this, but it is envisaged that Websockets will be the usual medium, on port 19800.

Subscriptions are handled in the usual way for JSON-RPC. A counterpart `unsubscribe...` RPC should be assumed for all `subscribe` RPCs; these are ommitted for brevity.

All parameters not described are assumed to be their canonical values. Some parameters are dependent on other values:
- $\mathsf{C} = \frac{\mathsf{V}}{3}$: The number of validators per core is always 3.
- $\mathsf{W}_G = 4,104$: The size of a (reconstructed) segment is fixed.
