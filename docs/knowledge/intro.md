This wiki hosts information for JAM implementers. The goal is to aid collaboration and [testnet
setup](https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet). Any information that is not specified in the [Gray
Paper](https://graypaper.com) can be added here.

Join us to build JAM (and win some [prizes](https://jam.web3.foundation/) ðŸ¤«):
