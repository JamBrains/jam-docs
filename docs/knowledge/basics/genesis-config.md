The genesis config provides the initial values that are needed by all nodes to start the JAM chain. Each field is explained below.

:::warning
This page is assumes that [JIP-5@7048f79](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/JIPs/pull/2) is accepted. The pre-JIP-5 version is available [here](../../old/genesis-config-pre-jip5.md).

## Authorities

A list of Validator Key Tuples, called $\mathbb{K}$ in the Graypaper. This defines the validators that are permissioned to seal blocks for the current epoch. The accounts are the [Dev Accounts](./dev-accounts.md).

## Genesis Block Header

The genesis block header ($H_0$) is the initial header in the chain, upon which
consensus is inherently assumed.

For the purpose of simplifying interoperability testing - such as importing test
vectors - we define the following values for the genesis header.

Expected hash: `0xe864d485113737c28c2fef3b2aed39cb2f289a369b15c54e9c44720bcfdc0ca0`

Binary encoding must adhere to the Block serialization specification established in the Gray Paper.

### Chosen Values Rationale

- `parent`: Set to zero because there is no parent block preceding the genesis block.  
- `parent_state_root`: Set to zero since there is no parent preceding the genesis state.  
- `extrinsic_hash`: There is no extrinsic to hash.
- `slot`: Set to `0` (representing the count of slots since the start of the Jam Common Era).  
- `epoch_mark`: The first block in an epoch should contain the validators for the next epoch.
  - `entropy`: Set to zero.  
  - `tickets_entropy`: No tickets exist, meaning no entropy is utilized.  
  - `validators`: Defined as the dev authorities [accounts](./dev-accounts.md).
- `tickets_mark`: No tickets are available to share.  
- `offenders_mark`: No offenders have been identified yet.  
- `author_index`: As this block has not been authored by a specific validator, use `0xffff` as a wildcard.  
- `entropy_source`: This block has not been signed by a specific validator.  
- `seal`: Similarly, this block has not been signed by a specific validator.  

For technical accuracy, the state referenced by this header hash, which
represents the genesis state ($Ïƒ_0$), should match with some of the values
presented within the header:
- `slot`: expected to match $\sigma_0 \cdot \tau$.
- `epoch_mark.entropy` expected to match $\sigma_0 \cdot \eta_1$.
- `epoch_mark.tickets_entropy` expected to match $\sigma_0 \cdot \eta_2$.
- `validators` expected to match $\sigma_0 \cdot \gamma_k$.

It is important to note that using this header as $H_0$ will inevitably
lead to small inconsistencies within the state it references, $\sigma_0$. These
inconsistencies violate certain invariants assumed for posterior states
referenced by other block header hashes when computed through the protocol's
State Transition Function (STF). Specifically, $\sigma_0 \cdot \eta_0$ is technically
expected to be derived from hashing a prior entropy value concatenated with
the fresh entropy generated by the `entropy_source` specified in the header.
However, because this header lacks a valid signature for the entropy source,
we adopt a lenient approach to these discrepancies during this initial testing
phase (and potentially in production as well).

## All Specs

Every spec has a unique genesis header hash. All genesis headers  generated in the same manner as
the `tiny` header. The only difference between them are the initial authorities.
