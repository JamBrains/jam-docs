# Full

The full scale version that will be known as the "JAM Chain". All parameters here must match the Gray Paper.

```yaml
chain: full
num_validators: 1023
num_cores: 341
slot_duration: 6
epoch_duration: 600
contest_duration: 500
tickets_per_validator: 2

The "full" name comes from the fact that full takes up the entire JAM "Toaster".
