# State Key Search

State keys in JAM are 31 bytes long and generated by the [state-key constructor function $C$](https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/7e6ff6a/3b11003b1100?v=0.6.7). $C$ is generally not invertible; it is therefore impossible to always reconstruct the input to $C$ from the key.

However, many state keys can be trivially inverted<sup>1</sup>:

- $C(1)$ - $C(16)$ invertible
- $C(255, s)$ invertible
- $C(s, ..)$ not invertible
