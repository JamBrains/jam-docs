This wiki hosts information for JAM implementers. The goal is to aid collaboration and [testnet
setup](https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet). Any information that is not specified in the [Gray
Paper](https://graypaper.com) can be added here.

Joins us to build JAM (and win some [prizes](https://jam.web3.foundation/) ðŸ¤«):
- [Telegram Testnet](https://t.me/jamtestnet): Causal and public channel to orchestrate on testnet setup.
- [Matrix Gray Paper](https://matrix.to/#/#graypaper:polkadot.io): Technical discussion about the Gray Paper - not implementations.
- [Matrix JAM](https://matrix.to/#/#jam:polkadot.io): Discussions about implementing the Gray Paper.
- [Matrix JAM0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Ar0CWH8cDq_mAoVkqZ20fXjfNQQ9ziv1jsVJBAfd1c/edit?gid=0#gid=0): Implementors only chat, ask a member to invite, eg `@sourabhniyogi`.

The [official](https://jam.web3.foundation/) and [unofficial](https://hackmd.io/@polkadot/jamprize) communication rules apply to all channels, have fun!
