Collaborative docs from the JAM implementer teams alongside the [Testnet Repo](https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet). The goal is to make it easier to build cross-team testnets.  

Joins us:
- [Telegram: Testnet](https://t.me/jamtestnet): Causal and public channel to orchestrate on testnet setup.
- [Matriy: Gray Paper](https://matrix.to/#/#graypaper:polkadot.io): Technical discussion about the Gray Paper - not implementations.
- [Matrix: JAM](https://matrix.to/#/#jam:polkadot.io): Discussions about implementing the Gray Paper.
- [Matrix: JAM0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Ar0CWH8cDq_mAoVkqZ20fXjfNQQ9ziv1jsVJBAfd1c/edit?gid=0#gid=0): Implementors only chat, ask a member to invite, eg `@sourabhniyogi`.

The [official](https://jam.web3.foundation/) and [unofficial](https://hackmd.io/@polkadot/jamprize) communication rules apply to all channels.
